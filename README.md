# üöÄ GETTING STARTED (5 mins!)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed (locally or on your cloud host)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- **Basic Python knowledge**
- A Docker-compatible hosting platform (Render, Scalingo, Heroku, etc.)

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

### Clone this Repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MultiBot.git
cd MultiBot
```

### Configure Your Bots:
Edit `config.json` to define as many bots as you want!
```json
{
  "EbookBot": {
    "source": "https://github.com/<username>/Ebooks-Bot.git",
    "env": {
      "TOKEN": "your-telegram-bot-token",
      "ID": "123",
      "HASH": "abc123"
    },
    "run": "main.py"
  },
  "PrivateBot": {
    "source": "https://<username>:<github-token>@github.com/<username>/private-bot.git",
    "env": {
      "TOKEN": "another-telegram-bot-token"
    },
    "run": "bot.py"
  }
}
```
- **Private bots?** Insert your GitHub token into the repo URL.
- **Each repo must have a `requirements.txt`.**
- Get your bot tokens from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).

---

### Make the Script Executable:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

### Build and Run Docker:
```bash
docker build -t multibots .
docker run -p 10000:10000 multibots
```
- Web server runs on **port 10000**.
- All bots start automatically!

---

### Deploy to the Cloud:
- Push your MultiBot repo to GitHub.
- Deploy to any Docker-compatible host (Render, Scalingo, Heroku, etc.).
- Set exposed port to **10000** on your dashboard.
- Watch your logs for startup messages.

---

# üíª HOW TO USE

- **Check your bots:** Visit `http://<your-host>:10000` (fun GIF = it's working!).
- **Add or remove bots:** Edit `config.json`, rebuild the Docker image.
- **Private repos:** Use your GitHub token in the URL.
- **Logs:** Use `docker logs` or your platform's dashboard for debugging.
- **Change environment variables:** Just update the `env` section per bot in `config.json`.

---

# üèóÔ∏è HOW IT WORKS (Under the Hood)

### Main Components

- **`main.py`:**  
  - Runs a Flask server for keep-alive and status page.
  - Reads `config.json`, spawns each bot as a separate subprocess with its own env.
  - Pings itself to prevent idling on free hosts.

- **`run.sh`:**  
  - Clones each bot repo.
  - Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

- **`Dockerfile`:**
  - Installs system dependencies (`git`, `jq`), Python, Flask, Requests.
  - Runs `run.sh` during build.
  - Starts `main.py` at runtime.

### Execution Flow

1. **Build Stage:**
   - System and Python deps installed.
   - Bot repos cloned, their dependencies installed.

2. **Run Stage:**
   - Flask server starts (port 10000).
   - Thread pings server every 120 secs (keeps it alive).
   - Reads `config.json`, spawns each bot with its own env.

3. **Bot Lifecycle:**
   - Each bot runs in its own directory.
   - Each gets its own environment (no secret leaks).
   - All logs available via Docker or your host's dashboard.

---

# ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS

- **Python Telegram bots ONLY** (no native Dockerfile-per-bot support).
- **Recommended:** Max 5 bots per 500MB RAM for best stability.
- **Must expose port 10000** on your host.
- **No built-in auto-redeploy** on `config.json` change (rebuild Docker image if you update bots).
